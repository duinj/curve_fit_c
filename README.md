## Simple method that fits a cauchy curve to 3 given points using levenberg - marquardt algorithm

could be useful to find simple gaussian and lorentzian fits, which appear in many natural processes

also includes a makefile to create a shared so file which can be used in python as well. if you ever used curve_fit in python you know how slow it is and this basically helps speeding things up after some data tweaking.
